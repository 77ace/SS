Aerobic, which uses air to compost, is quick, but high maintenance because your heap needs frequent turning; anaerobic, both low-maintenance and very slow, is done without air and involves letting waste sit undisturbed for years; vermicomposting employs red worms, bacteria and insects to break down matter (medium maintenance and speed).\nBut, as Brett L.

Michael Rich of UCLA has discovered that the central 2000 light years within the Milky Way Galaxy hosts an ancient population of stars. These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy.

This indicates that the ancient stars were assembled in a more quiescent environment than the central Galaxy today.\n\nThe astronomers also found that the ancient stars have a lower metallicity, meaning they have fewer heavy elements than the younger stars. This is consistent with the idea that the ancient stars formed from gas that had not yet been enriched by the nucleosynthetic products of earlier generations of stars.\n\nThe team also found that the ancient stars have a lower velocity dispersion than the younger stars.

Having spent approximately 48 hours of my life in the state\u2014and only for the interview process\u2014I fully expected Idaho to be true to the stereotype: potato fields as far the eye could see. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that while Idaho does, of course, have field upon field of potatoes, it also has breathtaking streams and rivers, snow-capped mountains, and pristine mountain lakes. My fisherman husband has been in fish-catching heaven ever since.\nBut in 2015, something strange happened\u201499 percent of the sockeye salmon run died. Dead fish. Everywhere. What happened? The water was clear, and food sources were readily available. It was as if there was something in the water, some unseen force at work, making the environment inhospitable.",

The bloom was the result of unusually warm water temperatures.\nThe Idaho sockeye salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow, and then return to freshwater to spawn. The warm water temperatures disrupted their life cycle.\nThe salmon are not the only ones affected by this phenomenon. Warmer water temperatures are causing problems for other fish species, as well as for amphibians, reptiles, and even for humans.\nThe warming trend is not limited to Idaho.

The trend is expected to continue, with the potential for even more drastic temperature increases.\n",
